            "details": "People do not pay attention to the correct method of standing. Some stand with the body weight thrown only on one leg, or with one leg turned completely sideways. Others bear all the weight on the heels, or on the inner or outer edges of the feet. This can be noticed by watching where the soles and heels of the shoes wear out. Owing to our faulty method of standing and not distributing the body weight evenly on the feet, we acquire specific deformities which hamper spinal elasticity. Even if the feet are kept apart, it is better to keep the heel and toe in a line parallel to the median plane and not at an angle. By this method, the hips are contracted, the abdomen is pulled in and the chest is brought forward. One feels light in body and the mind acquires agility. If we stand with the body weight thrown only on the heels, we feel the gravity changing; the hips become loose, the abdomen protrudes, the body hangs back and the spine feels the strain and consequently we soon feel fatigued and the mind becomes dull. It is therefore essential to master the art of standing correctly.",

                        insulted threw herself into the fire and perished. When Siva heard
                        this he was gravely provoked, tore a hair from his matted locks and
                        threw it to the ground. A powerful hero named Vlrabhadra rose up

                        s.acrifice, routed the other gods and priests and beheaded Daksa.
                        Siva in grief for Sat! withdrew to KaiHis and plunged into meditation.

                        once more for the love of Siva and ultimately won his heart. The story is told by Kalidasa in his great poem Kumiira sambhava (The Birth
                        of the War-Lord)

            "details": `The importance of Sarvangasana cannot be over-emphasised. It is one
                        of the greatest boons conferred on humanity by our ancient sages.
                        Sarvangasana is the Mother of asanas. As a mother strives for harmony
                        and happiness in the home, so this asana strives for the harmony and
                        happiness of the human system. It is a panacea for most common ailments
                        There are several endocrin;: organs or ductless glands in the
                        human system which bathe in blood, absorb the nutriments from the
                        blood and secrete hormones for the proper functioning of a balanced
                        and well developed body and brain. If the glands fail to function
                        properly, the hormones are not produced as they should be and the
                        body starts to deteriorate. Amazingly enough many of the asanas
                        have a direct effect on the glands and help them to function properly.
                        Sarvangasana does this for the thyroid and parathyroid glands which
                        are situated in the neck region, since due to the firm chinlock their
                        blood supply is increased. Further, since the body is inverted the
                        venous blood flows to the heart without any strain by force of gravity.
                        Healthy blood is allowed to circulate around the neck and chest. As
                        a result, persons suffering from breathlessness, palpitation, asthma,
                        bronchitis and throat ailments get relief. As the head remains firm in this
                        inverted position, and the supply of the blood to it is regulated by the
                        firm chinlock, the nerves are soothed and headaches-even chronic
                        ones-disappear. Continued practice of this asana eradicates common
                        colds and other nasal disturbances. Due to the soothing effect of the pose
                        on the nerves, those suffering from hypertension, irritation, shortness of
                        temper, nervous breakdown and insomnia are relieved. The change in
                        bodily gravity also affects the abdominal organs so that the bowels
                        move freely and constipation vanishes. As a result the system is freed
                        from toxins and one feels full of energy. The asana is recommended
                        for urinary disorders and uterine displacement, menstrual trouble, piles
                        and hernia. It also helps to relieve epilepsy, low vitality and anaemia.
                        It is no over-statement to say that if a person regularly practises
                        Sarvangasana he will feel new vigour and strength, and will be happy
                        and confident. New life will flow into him, his mind will be at peace
                        and he will feel the joy of life. After a long illness, the practice of this
                        asana regularly twice a day brings back lost vitality. The Sarvangasana
                        cycle activates the abdominal organs and relieves people suffering from
                        stomach and intestinal ulcers, severe pains in the abdomen and colitis.
                        People suffering from high blood pressure should not attempt
                        Salamba Sarvangasana I unless they do Jialasana (Plate 244) first and

              "Tighten the knees by pulling up the hamstring muscles at the back of the thighs and raise the trunk.",
              "Place the hands in the middle of the back and press it to keep the trunk perpendicular to the floor. (Plate 240)",
              "Stretch the arms on the floor in the direction opposite to that of the legs. (Plate 241)",
              "Hook the thumbs and stretch the arms and legs. (Plate 242)",
              "Interlock the fingers (Plate 243) and turn the wrists so that the thumbs rest on the floor. (Plate 244.) Stretch the palms along with the fingers, tighten the arms at the elbows and pull them from the shoulders.",
              "The legs and the hands are stretched in opposite directions and this stretches the spine completely.",
              "While interlocking the fingers, it is advisable to change the interlock. Suppose that the right thumb touches the floor first, maintain the position for a minute. Then release the grip and bring the left thumb first on the floor, follow the interlock, finger by finger, and stretch out the arms for the same length of time. This will lead to harmonious development and elasticity of both the shoulders, elbows, and wrists.",
              "In the beginning, interlocking will be difficult. By gradual practice of the above-mentioned positions, you will interlock the fingers easily.",
              "In the beginning, it is also difficult to keep the toes firmly on the floor behind the head. If you lengthen the timing and stretch of Sarvangasana I (Plate 223) before going into Halasana, the toes will remain longer on the floor.",
              "Remain in the attainable pose from one to five minutes with normal breathing.",

            "details": `Verse 32 of the First Chapter of the H a?ha Yoga Pradipika states :
                        Lying upon one's back on the ground at full length like a corpse is
                        called Savasana. This removes the fatigue caused by the other asanas
                        and induces calmness of mind.'
                        Mrtasana is thus described in verse I r of the Second Chapter of the
                        Gherar:cfa Samhita: 'Lying fiat on the ground (on one's back) like a
                        corpse is called Mrtasana. This posture destroys fatigue, and quiets the
                        agitation of the mind.'
                        'The mind is the lord of the Indriyas (the organs of senses); the
                        Pral!a (the Breath of Life) is the lord of the mind.' 'When the mind
                        is absorbed it is called Mokï¿½a (final emancipation, liberation of the soul); when Prï¿½a and Manas (the mind) have been absorbed, an undefinable joy ensues.' Verses 29 and 30, chapter IV, H arha Yoga
                        Pradipika.
                        To tame Prï¿½a depends upon the nerves. Steady, smooth, fine and
                        deep breathing without any jerky movements of the body soothes the
                        nerves and calms the mind. The stresses of modern civilisation are a
                        '
                        strain on the nerves for which Savasana is the best antidote. `,

            "intro": `Sava or Mrta means a corpse. In this asana the object is to imitate a
                      corpse. Once life has departed, the body remains still and no movements are possible. By remaining motionless for some time and keeping
                      the mind still while you are fully conscious, you learn to relax. This
                      conscious relaxation invigorates and refreshes both body and mind. But
                      it is much harder to keep the mind than the body still. Therefore, this
                      apparently easy posture is one of the most difficult to master. `,

              "To start with, breathe deeply. Later the breathing should be fine and slow, with no jerky movements to disturb the spine or the body.",
              "Concentrate on deep and fine exhalations, in which the nostrils do not feel the warmth of breath.",
              "The lower jaw should hang loose and not be clenched. The tongue should not be disturbed, and even the pupils of the eyes should be kept completely passive.",
              "Relax completely and breathe out slowly.",
              "If the mind wanders, pause without any strain after each slow exhalation.",
              "Stay in the pose from 15 to 20 minutes.",
              "One is apt to fall asleep in the beginning. Gradually, when the nerves become passive, one feels completely relaxed and refreshed. In good relaxation, one feels energy flow from the back of the head towards the heels and not the other way round. One also feels as if the body is elongated."
